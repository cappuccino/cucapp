# Welcome to Cuccap

## Introduction

Cucapp is an interface between Cucumber (see: http://cukes.info) and Cappuccino.

The Cappuccino application is served via thin and a small piece of code is injected.
This code connects back to your Cucumber script via AJAX requests

This code is based heavily on Brominet (see: http://github.com/textarcana/brominet)

Original Concept and Developer: Daniel Parnell (see: https://github.com/dparnell)


## Installation

To get started, download the current version of Cuccap:

    $ git clone git://github.com/cappuccino/cucapp.git (git)

Then install cucapp on your system:

    $ jake install

The following gems are going to be installed:

- Cucumber
- Thin
- Nokogiri
- JSON
- Watir-Webdriver

The command `cucapp` is now available in your system. This command allows you to create a testing architecture for your cappuccino application. To do that, you need to do :

    $ cucapp -p  /path/to/your/application

Once you have installed everything, you need to use `jake cucumber-test` to launch the tests from the cappuccino application folder.

By default, cucapp will launch phantomjs to perform your tests. If you want to to use Chrome or Safari you will need to install the following webdrivers : http://watirwebdriver.com/safari/ - http://watirwebdriver.com/chrome/. Cucapp supports firefox as well.

## Usage

#### Environement Variables

You can set different env variables to configure Cucapp :

Cucapp provides a set of environment variables :

* `$CUCAPP_PORT` allows you to specify the port used by the Thin server.
* `$CUCAPP_APPDIRECTORY` allows you to specify where the Cappuccino application is located.
* `$CUCAPP_BUNDLE` allows you to specify if you want to use the compiled version of Cucapp.
* `$CUCAPP_APPLOADINGMODE` allows you to specify which version (`build` or `debug`) of your Cappuccino application you want to test.
* `BROWSER_FULL_SCREEN` allows to put the browser in full screen (`true` or `false` which is the default value)
* `BROWSER_SIZE_WIDTH` the browser width size.
* `BROWSER_SIZE_HEIGHT` the browser height size.
* `BROWSER` the browser desired for the test suite. By default it will launch phantomjs (version >2.0)
* `WATIR_CHROME_DRIVER` the path where Watir locates your ChromeDriver binary.
* `WATIR_CHROME_SWITCHES` the switches for ChromeDriver to start with.

#### Global variable

The global variable `$url_params` (which is a dictionary) allows you to specify URL params between each scenarios (need to be changed in the hooks).

#### Categories

- `CPResponder+CuCapp.j` contains a category of `CPResponder`. It adds the method `-(void)setCucappIdentifier:`. This `cucappIdentifier` can be used to identify the control with its XPath. You need to include this category in your Cappuccino application to use cucappIdentifiers. With that, you can use a xpath such as `//CPButton[cucappIdentifier='cucappIdentifier-button-bar-add']`. This category contains also a CLI mode for Cucapp, more informations below.

- `Cucumber+Extensions.j` will be loaded (optionally) by Cucapp when launching Cucumber. It allows you to add new Cappuccino methods needed for your own tests (for instance a method to check the color of a CPView). This file has to be located in `features/support/Cucumber+Extensions.j`.

#### Features

Cucapp provides a set of basic methods who can be called from Cucumber (take a look at encumber.rb and Cucumber.j). You should mainly used the following methods :

```ruby
    def simulate_keyboard_event charac, flags
    def simulate_keyboard_events string, flags
    def simulate_left_click xpath, flags
    def simulate_left_click_on_point x, y, flags
    def simulate_right_click xpath, flags
    def simulate_right_click_on_point x, y, flags
    def simulate_double_click xpath, flags
    def simulate_double_click_on_point x, y, flags
    def simulate_mouse_moved xpath, flags
    def simulate_mouse_moved_on_point x, y, flags
    def simulate_dragged_click_view_to_view xpath1, xpath2, flags
    def simulate_dragged_click_view_to_point xpath1, x, y, flags
    def simulate_dragged_click_point_to_point x, y, x2, y2, flags
    def simulate_scroll_wheel xpath, deltaX, deltaY, flags
````

Cucapp automatically simulates several CPMouseMoved events between two simulated events generated by the tester. Like a real user does.

Example of a step:

 ```ruby
I want to fill a form and send the informations do
  app.gui.wait_for                    "//CPTextField[cucappIdentifier='field-name']"
  app.gui.simulate_left_click         "//CPTextField[cucappIdentifier='field-name']", []
  app.gui.simulate_keyboard_event     "a", [$CPCommandKeyMask]
  app.gui.simulate_keyboard_event     $CPDeleteCharacter, []
  app.gui.simulate_keyboard_events    "my_new_name", []
  app.gui.simulate_keyboard_event     $CPTabCharacter , []
  app.gui.simulate_keyboard_events    "my_new_family_name_", []
  app.gui.simulate_left_click         "//CPButton[cucappIdentifier='button-send']", []
end
```

The rest is pure Cucumber, don't hesitate to take a look at their website ;) (see: http://cukes.info)

Cucapp provides a screenshot feature. When you want to take a screenshot, you need to perform this code :

```ruby
    app.gui.make_screenshot_with_name    "name_of_file"
```

### Default steps

Cucuapp provides a set of default steps :

```ruby
Given the application is lauched
When I close the popover
When I hit the key c
When I hit the mask shif and the key c
When I hit the keys cucapp
When I hit the mask shif and the keys cucapp
When I select all
When I save the document
When I (click|right click|double click) on the field with the value cucapp
When I click on the field with the property cucapp-identifier and the property-value cucapp-identifier-button-add
When I click with the mask shift on the field with the property cucapp-identifier and the property-value cucapp-identifier-button-add
When I do a drag and drop from the field with the value cucapp to the field with the value cappuccino
When I do a drag and drop from the field with the property title and property-value cucapp to the field with the property title and property-value cappuccino
When I do a drag and drop with the key mask shift from the field with the property title and property-value cucapp to the field with the property title and property-value cappuccino
When I vertically|horizontally scroll on the field with the value cappuccino
When I (vertically|horizontally) scroll 10 times on the field with the value cappuccino
When I (vertically|horizontally) scroll 10 times on the field with the property title and the property-value cappuccino
When I (vertically|horizontally) scroll 10 times on the field with the property title and the property-value cappuccino
Then the field should not have a value
Then the field with the property cucapp-identifier and the property-value cucapp-identifier-textfield-description should not have a value
Then the field should have the value cucapp
Then the field with the property cucapp-identifier and the property-value cucapp-identifier-textfield-description should have the value cucapp
```

#### CLI

Cucapp contains a CLI mode. To use it, make sure your application import the category `CPResponder+CuCapp.j` and open the javascript console of your browser.

To load the CLI mode, you need to call the function `function load_cucapp_CLI(path)`. The path argument represents the path to the file `Cucumber.j`. By default this is set to `../../Cucapp/lib/Cucumber.j`. Once you have loaded the CLI, you can use the following methods :

``` javascript
function simulate_keyboard_event(character, flags)
function simulate_keyboard_events(string, flags)
function simulate_left_click_on_view(aKey, aValue, flags)
function simulate_left_click_on_point(x, y, flags)
function simulate_right_click_on_view(aKey, aValue, flags)
function simulate_right_click_on_point(x, y, flags)
function simulate_double_click_on_view(aKey, aValue, flags)
function simulate_double_click_on_point(x, y, flags)
function simulate_mouse_moved_on_view(aKey, aValue, flags)
function simulate_mouse_moved_on_point(x, y, flags)
function simulate_dragged_click_view_to_view(aKey, aValue, aKey2, aValue2, flags)
function simulate_dragged_click_view_to_point(aKey, aValue, x, y, flags)
function simulate_dragged_click_point_to_point(x, y, x1, y2, flags)
function simulate_scroll_wheel_on_view(aKey, aValue, deltaX, deltaY, flags)
function find_control(aKey, aValue)
```

For example, to simulate a left click on a button with a `cucappIdentifier` set to "button-login", you need to do:

``` javascript
load_cucapp_CLI()
simulate_left_click_on_view(“cucappIdentifier, “button-login", [])
```
